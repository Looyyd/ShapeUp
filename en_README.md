# LO02
This project in Java has been realized during the fall semester 2020 as a final project in a teaching unit called Principle and practice of object programming.
 
 The instructions of the project can be consulted in 'PROJECT LO02.pdf'(french only).
 The rules of the game are at the end of this document.

**To summarize the instructions:**
We had to implement a card game in 3 steps
- first model the game
- then code the logic engine of the game and be able to play against computers in command line
- finally implement the graphical interface while still being able to play on the command line
All this while respecting the practices of object-oriented programming and keeping the project easily scalable.

The report has been submitted in January 2021
We managed to implement the game without any major bugs, the most difficult part being the implementation of the graphical interface 
because keeping the game playable in command line and GUI at the same time required to restructure most of the code; a game round had to be divided in several distinct steps
but we didn't always manage to respect the good practices, I corrected some of the worst mistakes in March 2021.
 
 
 To play without recreating from the source files you can use the .jar archive 'Executable.jar'** However it requires the folder
 en.utt.LO02.ShapeUp.images folder for the images to be displayed. 
 On Linux you can run it with the command: java -jar Executable.jar
